# computer science notes

This document gathers all my notes about computer science. The goal here is
to share my work and to commit myself into the redaction of a proper document.
If my work is useful to you, or if some concepts are missing, please let me know.

## How to compile

Theses notes are split into LaTeX subfiles, each one can be compiled independently.
To ease the compilation process, this repository provide a Makefile with the required steps.
I'm currently using `lualatex` to render pdfs with `biber` for citations and `makeglossaries` for accronyms.
